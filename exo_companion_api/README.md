## Installation

If you want to install ExoCompanion Locally you need some prerequisites to make this work.

### Docker Way

- Install Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation Way

- Install Node 20.x.x
- Install Java 21.x.x
- Install Maven latest
- Install Docker & Docker Compose

## Development

### Run Local DEV Environment

```shell
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Run Local UAT Environment

```shell
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
```

## Tests

With ExoCompanion we test each module before release, that means we do unit and integration tests (automated) before new
features reach the customer. What do we test how ?

**Unit Tests**:

- Repository
- Service

**Integration Tests**:

- Controller

### Run Tests

**Maven Profiles:**

```xml
